## CRITICAL: Read Project Structure Documentation First

**Before starting any task, you MUST:**
1. Read `AI_PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` (if it exists) to understand the project structure
2. This file contains a map of all files, their purposes, parameters, outputs, and when to read them
3. Use it to identify which files are relevant for your task - do NOT read entire projects unnecessarily
4. If `AI_PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` doesn't exist, analyze the codebase structure first to understand it

## File Update Protocol

**After completing any task that modifies code structure, you MUST update `AI_PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`:**

### When to Update:
- ✅ Added new file with significant functionality
- ✅ Changed function/class signatures (parameters, return types)
- ✅ Modified API endpoints or request/response schemas
- ✅ Updated database models or schemas
- ✅ Added/removed dependencies between files
- ✅ Changed architectural patterns
- ✅ Created new pages/components with important functionality

### What to Document:
- New files and their purpose
- Modified functions with updated parameters/outputs
- Changed dependencies
- Updated architecture patterns
- New API endpoints or routes

### When NOT to Update:
- ❌ Simple bug fixes (typos, logic errors)
- ❌ Style/formatting changes
- ❌ Comments/documentation updates
- ❌ Configuration changes without structural impact

## Code Structure Understanding

Use `AI_PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` to:
- Quickly identify which files to read for specific tasks
- Understand function signatures without reading source code
- Know dependencies between files
- Follow the "Quick Reference" section for common tasks

## Task Workflow

1. **Read** `AI_PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` first (or analyze structure if it doesn't exist)
2. **Identify** relevant files from the document
3. **Read only** the files needed for your task
4. **Make changes**
5. **Update** `AI_PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` if structure changed (see "When to Update" above)
6. **Commit** changes together (code + documentation updates)

## Efficiency Rules

- Do NOT read entire projects when you can use the structure documentation
- Do NOT read every file in a directory - use the documentation to target specific files
- DO use the "Quick Reference" section to find which files relate to your task
- DO update the documentation as part of your task completion
